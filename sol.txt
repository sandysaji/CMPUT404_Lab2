Question 1: How do you specify a TCP socket in Python?
-> we use s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM). This will create a socket for us.

Question 2: What is the difference between a client socket and a server socket in Python?
-> For server socket, we bind the Ip and port number and listen for a connection while a client sockets connects to a server.

Question 3: How do we instruct the OS to let us reuse the same bind port?
->  We will use setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET,socket.SO_REUSEADDR,1).

Question 4: What information do we get about incoming connections?
-> We need the port number and Ip address

Question 5: What is returned by recv() from the server after it is done sending the HTTP request?
-> The data recieved.

Question 6: Provide a link to your code on GitHub.
